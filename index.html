            Right at this moment when the year has changed. Firstly i wannna say
            happy new year, happpy new page and thanks for surviving 2023...so
            how did it feel? tentunya kita udah ngalamin banyak hal baru ditahun
            sebelumnya. Banyak pengalaman baru yang bisa kita jadiin pelajaran
            ditahun kemarin, apalagi insiden ppdb yang ngebikin kita bener-bener
            budrek sampe nangis T_T dan dari situ kita jadi beda sekolah wrwrwr
            (its hard to me). But its okay everything will go well as long as i
            belong to you and you belong to me. New year, maybe in this year
            we'll feel new things that have never happened and we feel in the
            previous year, but i still feel the same thing about someone...
            love, comfort, anger, sadness, even jealousy. I hope i can feel all
            those feelings and emotions with someone who has been stole my heart
            for along time. She's my home, my world, most of my heart has been
            entrusted to her, all my emotions, and what i mean is you Aisha Ayu
            Aletha
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope in this new year many positive things will come to us, so
            that we can learn from the experience. Let's grow and move at our
            current age because the future is in sight, let's succeed together
            and honestly i still need you to share and also support all my
            emotional feelings. Semoga ditahun yang baru ini kita bisa lebih
            berkembang daripada tahun-tahun sebelumnya dan juga diberi kemudahan
            dalam hal apapun. Juga aku harap Etha bisa lebih bahagia ditahun
            ini, more happy, more pretty, and more cutieee :3 xixixi
          </p>
          <p>
            And lastly i hope we can still be together to keep sending love to
            each other, for all the new things that will come to us, for all the
            places we will go, for all the movies we will watch, the roads we
            have never walk, some ice cream and noodle restaurants, all the
            things we have never tried. I wanna fell all those things just with
            you, so please stay by side for a thousand years to come, can you?
            Yeahh just live with it first, right?? so HAPPY NEW YEAR LOVELIEST!!
